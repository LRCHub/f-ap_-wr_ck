I let you in
You sunk your knife so deep
Under my skin
And cut my heart from me
Where did you go
Where's the person
you used to be
I don't know you
And you don't know me
You're all alone
And you only refuse to see
Let me show you
What you can't show me
I will erase the nightmare
you became
It comes in waves
you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare
you became
Night are
You're in my head
Buried so deep inside
You want me dead
But I feel so alive
Look at you now
That there's nowhere for you
to run
I cut you out
And the pain is gone
I had my doubts
When it started to come undone
You fucked around
And you broke my trust
I will erase the nightmare
you became
It comes in waves
you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare
you became
Nightmare
Now I lay me down to sleep
You're the devil in my dreams
Swear to god I will erase
This nightmare you became
Now I lay me down to sleep
You're the devil in my dreams
Swear to god I will erase
This nightmare you became
I will erase the nightmare
you became
It comes in waves
you're everything I hate
You try to drag me down
I'll cut you out and now
I will erase the nightmare
you became
Nightmare
