Victims Family
White Bread Blues
Supermarket Nightmare
When I go to the super store
People look so tired and bored and their backs are sore.
As I walk up and down the aisles
The people they don't smile they look so vile.
They shop around and blanky stare.
They seem so unware. I look inside of their
S-h-o-p-p-i-n-g c-a-r-t, what do you think I see?

White bread blues
White sugar cubes
Black tar and nicotine
Red meat schemes

Dad, he had a heart attack,
Mom's got a bending back and a choking hack.
Little sister's got a lumpy chest
Cancer of the breast, all the rest.
And Bobby Joe just can't sit still
He's got to take a pill or else he gets ill.
And oh we're such a healthy family,
We take our vitamin C, wash it down with Pepsi.

Fruits are gassed and waxed and nuked,
Till it is not a fruit, it makes me wanna puke.
Bred for looks and not for taste,
For dollars and for haste, it's such a waste.
And I feel sorry for the lambs,
The turkeys and the hams caught in the scam.
I know "we are not what we eat, we are what we don't shit*"
And that is it.

White bread blues
White sugar cubes
Black tar and nicotine
Red meat schemes
