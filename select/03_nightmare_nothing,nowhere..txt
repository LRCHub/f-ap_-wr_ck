(Nightmare, nightmare
I'm livin' in a nightmare
Nightmare, nightmare)
I live inside the nighttime
She said, "I didn't feel like it's the right time"
Well, I saw you with a new boy
I'm lookin' for somethin' that I could destroy
You know I hate it when you tease me
I see you every night when I am dreaming
Yeah, every time I see you right there
You turn a dream into a fuckin' nightmare, yeah
I'm headed off the deep end
Since you left, I swear I'm barely breathin'
Lately, I've been steady speedin'
4 AM debatin' with my demons
I've been feelin' like it's too late, too late
Every day is like a doomsday, doomsday
I pull up on him with my switchblade, switchblade
And make him get a taste of my pain, my pain
I live inside the nighttime
She said, "I didn't feel like it's the right time"
Well, I saw you with a new boy
I'm lookin' for somethin' that I could destroy
You know I hate it when you tease me
I see you every night when I am dreaming
Yeah, every time I see you right there
You turn a dream into a fuckin' nightmare, yeah
Dreaming of your hands, how they felt inside mine
I can't understand why you wasted my time
Playing Russian roulette, I'm by myself, 'cause
You live in my head
I live inside the nighttime
She said, "I didn't feel like it's the right time"
Well, I saw you with a new boy
I'm lookin' for somethin' that I could destroy
You know I hate it when you tease me
I see you every night when I am dreaming
Yeah, every time I see you right there
You turn a dream into a fuckin' nightmare, yeah
(Nightmare, nightmare
I'm livin' in a nightmare
Nightmare, nightmare
I'm livin' in a nightmare)
